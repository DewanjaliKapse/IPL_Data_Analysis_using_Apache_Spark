# IPL_Data_Analysis_using_Apache_Spark

## Introduction
In this project, we will analyze IPL data by building a robust data pipeline. The focus will be on writing Apache Spark code and leveraging various functions for data transformation. We'll utilize Amazon S3 for data storage, Apache Spark for processing, SQL for querying, and Databricks for visualization. This project will showcase how to efficiently handle and analyze large datasets in a cloud environment.
